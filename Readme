There are two programs in this directory. They illustrate the use of TCP and
select() system call.

The echoServer.cpp contains an ECHO server program that implements an ECHO
service. After establishing connections with clients, an ECHO server receives
byte strings from them and echos them back. The ECHO server can service
multiple clients concurrently. It uses port number 5004 as the default port.
Another port number pn may be specified as a command line parameter.
If during binding process, it finds that port 5004 (or pn) is in use, it
requests the system to allocate a port, and prints the new port number on
standard output.

USAGE: echoServer [port]

The echoClient.cpp contains an ECHO client program. An ECHO client first
establishes a connection with the ECHO server, the requests and waits for the 
private key decryption password. If the correct key is provided the program
then repeatedly reads character strings from standard input, sends them to 
the ECHO server via SSL, receives them from the ECHO server via SSL, and
then prints them on the standard output.

USAGE: echoClient [port [host]]

Compile these programs as follows: 

All: make all
Client: make client
Server: make server

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT: These programs are a modification of the ECHO server and
ECHO client programs presented in the book `Internetworking with TCP/IP',
